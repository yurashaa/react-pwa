# PWA

**Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)** are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in 
combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native apps.

## Benefits

- **Like a Native App**. the design of PWAs is similar to the Native apps’ design, PWAs and Native apps have a similar 
effect on user experience, the same speed, responsiveness, and comprehensive capabilities of websites with database 
access and automatic data.  

- **Quick and Easy To Install**. PWAs are installed straight from the web browser to any device. The installed app 
remains on the desktop or mobile device home screen and can be easily accessed from there.

- **Enhanced Performance**. The running speed of a progressive web app improves due to the fact that this app can 
function in an efficient manner, operate like a website, cache, and serve text, images, and other content.

- **Operating Offline**. PWAs can operate offline. Thus, when your network connection is unstable this type of app will 
still work as a clock, but in offline mode.

- **Updating Silently**. Progressive Web Apps updates are automatic. The app does not notify its user about the upcoming
updates and does not require user permission to update itself. The trick is that every time a user opens the app it 
updates immediately without downloading any batch changes and installing them.

- **Sending Push Notifications**. Commonly to the Native applications, PWAs also use the devices push-notification
feature. This is a perfect capability for companies and their advertising campaigns. Why is this opportunity so great? 
Because users allow their PWAs to send them notifications and these notifications are highly noticeable on mobile screens.  

- **No App Distribution Platforms**. Choosing PWAs you choose to be free of the distribution platform requirements and
possible time waste and cost lost based on missing to meet some of the minor requirements.

- **More Efficient Security**. PWAs use HTTPS to manage and maintain the safety of data stored within them, eliminate
risks of security breaches, snooping, content tampering, and other illegal activity.

- **Eliminating the Development Cost**. PWA becomes a good investment when it comes to functioning on different devices
and adjusting to the screen sizes.

- **Supports SEO**. Unlike native apps, Progressive Web Apps support SEO (Search Engine Optimization). For example, 
the websites can read by Google’s ‘crawlers’, so that the content of the PWA can be found within the search results 
of the Google search engine.

## Pitfalls

- **No access to apps stores**. Users have to visit the website themselves before they can add the app on their phone screen.

- **Fewer functionalities**. Not all functionalities of the device can be used (for example, you cannot access contacts,
calendar, Bluetooth or NFC).

- **Still in the development phase**. The PWA and its compatibility with (mobile) browsers and operating systems is still
under development. For example, Apple doesn’t support all the functionalities of a PWA, so the user experience will in 
some cases be more limited. 

- **Performance**. With a PWA you can achieve good results when it comes to performance, but the performance of native 
apps is still much higher than that of a PWA.

## PWA Vs Web App

### Similarities

- They’re all websites in essence, since their core is web technology. 
- The web app and PWA are designed to deliver diverse and highly interactive experiences. As a result, their appearance 
and working ability are all optimized.
- The development and maintenance process of web apps and PWAs saves businesses time and money. Since then profits are 
also greater.
- Ultimately, they are all designed to deliver a great customer experience.

### Differences

- Installation process. While the web app can only be used through a web browser, the PWA can be added to the home screen
through the web browser or app stores.
- PWA is still more similar to an app. It can hide the browser bar and be browser-independent.
- PWA’s abilities are outstanding and much more effective with push notification, offline mode, etc.
- PWA can enhance customer experience better than a web app. It allows users to access cross-browser. Its speed is also
impressive, thanks to a good page loading process.

### PWA vs Native App

- **Download & Installation**. PWAs give you an edge in this scenario. A user doesn’t have to install a PWA to find some
info, interacting with a business or make a purchase, as in the case with native mobile apps.

- **Performance**. Progressive web apps load faster, but they run on a third-party browser. This means there will always
be chances of latency and significant battery consumption. On the other hand, a native app integrates seamlessly as a 
part of the smartphone once installed. It can use the hardware and device features better than PWAs. Also, native mobile
applications are more powerful and score high on performance because of the platform-centric code.

- **Features & Functionalities**. A native app can provide a better set of features and functionalities than a progressive
web application. Features like geofencing, mobile payments via NFCs, inter-app functionality, and smart sensor usage 
doesn’t work well with a PWA.
Also, delivering push notifications on iOS isn’t possible using a PWA. 

- **Offline availability**. PWAs can promise offline functionality by delivering certain parts of the web app at a time.
However, if the user requests any info (or feature) which isn’t part of the natural caching system, PWAs have limitations.
On the other hand, native apps fare far better on this front. A native app will deliver a consistent experience 
(information and offline functionality) even when the user is not connected to the internet 24×7.
